# Project Overview
Anemia is a common blood disorder that can often be visually identified by changes in the conjunctiva of the eye. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to automate the detection of anemia by analyzing conjunctiva images. The repository contains code and resources related to data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset
We used a curated dataset of conjunctiva images collected from various sources. The dataset consists of images categorized into two classes: 'Anemic' and 'Non-Anemic'. The images have been preprocessed and augmented to ensure diversity and enhance the model's robustness.

Model Development
Our approach involves training a deep learning model using state-of-the-art architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset and fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance in classifying anemia from conjunctiva images.

## Usage
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AnemiaDetectionFromConjunctiva.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd AnemiaDetectionFromConjunctiva
```

Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the inference script on your conjunctiva image:
```
python predict.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```
